>> Project Overview

Osiris is a modular Python-based framework designed to simplify the development of command-line tools and utility-driven applications. The project focuses on providing a structured foundation with reusable components such as command execution, safety checks, logging, and shared helper utilities. It is built to promote clean architecture, scalability, and maintainability.

Osiris is suitable for developers who want a flexible base for building CLI tools, automation scripts, or backend utilities without repeatedly writing boilerplate code.
